R/LME/N-3 - Alleviating Regulatory Impediments To Native Shellfish Aquaculture      
Progress Report: January 2014 â€“ January 2015 

A significant impediment to sustainable aquaculture is the lack of proper information to predict the impacts of culturing native shellfish species for restoration and commercial production. As a result, expansion and growth of domestic aquaculture is constrained and may be halted by management directives that restrict distribution of hatchery derived native shellfish until the potential interactions are better understood. The overall goals of this project are to increase our knowledge of local adaptation in Olympia oysters to address concerns that interbreeding between potentially maladapted cultured and wild stocks could negatively impact wild populations. Over the current reporting period we successfully completed research objective 1, to evaluate fitness components and performance of seed from different origins in a reciprocal transplant experiment. This research effort culminated in the preprint published in December 2014 [Heare JE, Blake B, Davis JP, Vadopalas B, Roberts SB. (2015) Evidence of _Ostrea lurida_ (Carpenter 1864) population structure in Puget Sound, WA. PeerJ PrePrints 3:e1106 https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.704v2]. The paper is currently out for peer-review.
